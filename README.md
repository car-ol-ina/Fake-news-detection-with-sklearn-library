# Fake-news-detection-with-sklearn-library
We will use Python to build a model that can accurately detect whether a piece of news is real or fake. 
We’ll build a TfidfVectorizer and use a PassiveAggressiveClassifier to classify news into “Real” and “Fake”. 
We’ll be using a dataset of shape 7796×4.

## The Dataset
The dataset we’ll use for this python project- we’ll call it news.csv. 
This dataset has a shape of 7796×4. 
The first column identifies the news, the second and third are the title and text, and the fourth column has labels denoting whether the news is REAL or FAKE. 

## Prerequisites

#### Install the following libraries with pip:
>> pip install numpy pandas sklearn
